## What is Scrivito ?

- The Scrivito CMS consists of two main components interacting with each other: a backend, which transparently manages your content, and a JavaScript library (SDK) that acts as a content management layer in a web application based on React.

- React is Facebook's solution to building interactive web interfaces using self-contained components written in JavaScript. The Scrivito SDK utilizes React to access and render the content in your Scrivito CMS and also include Scrivito's unparalleled user interface for managing content and editing in place.
